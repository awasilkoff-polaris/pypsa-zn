# test_ercot7k_results.py
#
# Purpose
#   Test ercot7k_results.py against the REAL validated PSO run of the shipped
#   ERCOT Texas7k case. No AIMMS seat is needed for any of this: the run is a
#   committed artifact, and reading it is the whole point of the module.
#
#   Concrete numbers are asserted, not shapes. A mapper that returns a
#   plausibly-shaped dict of wrong numbers is the failure mode here, because
#   nothing downstream can tell.
#
# What it does
#   - Asserts the real run's headline figures: 190 MC_Solution rows all
#     Optimal, the RT/DA/SC MC_Hrzn.DeltaCost sums, the pinned RT peak
#     interval, 6717 LMP rows after dropping Reference_*, <= 1171 paths.
#   - Asserts the PF_AraNde.LoadFactor renormalization, which the whole
#     bus_net_import artifact stands on, including the measured raw sum that
#     makes the renormalization necessary.
#   - Asserts the artifact byte format against a hand-built pd.Series and
#     against the committed devnet reference run.
#   - Maps a base run with no manifest and asserts the DC columns are absent.
#   - Builds a synthetic results directory carrying a deliverable-failure
#     datacenter, because the shipped run has no datacenter and therefore
#     cannot exercise the asymptote metric at all.
#   - Asserts determinism: mapping twice is byte-identical.
#
# Outputs
#   - pytest results only. Everything is written under tmp_path.
#
# Run: python -m pytest tests/test_ercot7k_results.py -q
