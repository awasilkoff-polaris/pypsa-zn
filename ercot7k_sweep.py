# ercot7k_sweep.py
#
# Purpose
#   Sweep ONE stress lever across a range on the ERCOT Texas7k PSO case: build a
#   derived layer per step, solve it, map the results at the study's pinned
#   interval, and write one summary table for the whole sweep.
#
#   An importable module with a CLI, like ercot7k_results.py -- NOT an
#   interactive front end like ercot7k_build.py. A sweep is n solves of roughly
#   six minutes each; it has to be startable and then left alone, and every
#   choice it makes belongs on a command line that can be read back afterwards
#   rather than in a prompt nobody recorded.
#
#   The whole design question here is not "how do I loop" -- it is "how does
#   this sweep's own output prove the lever was applied". devnet's
#   run_sweep_line answers that question with nothing at all, and is wrong in
#   two independent ways (see THE TWO INHERITED DEFECTS below), so neither
#   failure is visible in its summary CSV. Every step here therefore carries a
#   WITNESS: a quantity read back out of the SOLVED results that can only move
#   if the lever reached the solver. A sweep whose witness never moves is
#   reported as a failed sweep, not as a flat response curve.
#
# What it does
#   - plan : print the steps, the witness, and the projected wall clock and
#            disk, then stop. The cheap way to find a bad range before an hour
#            of solving.
#   - run  : build + solve + map one layer per step, writing a step record as
#            each finishes, then the summary table and the verdict.
#   - check: re-run the verdict over an existing sweep directory's step
#            records, without solving anything.
#
# Outputs
#   - ercot7k-sweeps/<sweep_id>/sweep.json        the plan, written before step 1
#   - ercot7k-sweeps/<sweep_id>/step_<nn>.json    one per completed step
#   - ercot7k-sweeps/<sweep_id>/sweep_summary.csv the table
#   - ercot7k-sweeps/<sweep_id>/sweep_report.txt  the verdict
#   - ercot7k-sweeps/<sweep_id>/artifacts/        mapped artifacts per step
#   - ercot7k-derived/<parent>__<lever><value>/   one case layer per step
#   - ercot7k-runs/<sweep_id>-<nn>-<slug>/        one PSO run per step
#
# Run: python ercot7k_sweep.py plan --help
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE TWO INHERITED DEFECTS
#
# Both are live in lib/devnet_stress_lib.py::run_sweep_line on main, both were
# reported to ZeroNode, and neither is inherited here. They are written out
# because "we avoided them" is worth nothing without saying what they were.
#
# 1. THE SWEEP DOES NOT APPLY THE SWEEP. Inside run_sweep_line's loop the only
#    corridor call is apply_corridor_reducers(n, parse_json_dict(args.k_line)) --
#    the loop variable k appears nowhere in it and is used ONLY to label the
#    output row. Every step solves the identical network while the summary
#    reports a moving k. Nothing in that CSV can distinguish it from a network
#    that genuinely does not respond.
#
#    Not inherited structurally: build_step_rows() puts the step value in the
#    one place the layer is built from, so a step that failed to apply it could
#    not produce a layer at all. Not inherited observably either: the witness
#    is read back from the results and checked against what the layer WROTE, so
#    the claim rests on a measurement rather than on the code being right.
#
# 2. DESCENDING SWEEPS DROP THEIR LAST POINT. np.arange(kmin, kmax + 1e-9,
#    kstep): the +1e-9 endpoint guard only helps an ASCENDING step, and every
#    preset in devnet_stress.py uses a negative one, so kmin=1.0 kmax=0.2
#    kstep=-0.1 yields 8 steps ending at 0.3 and silently never solves the
#    0.2 case -- the most interesting point of the sweep, and the reason the
#    sweep was run.
#
#    Not inherited: sweep_steps() counts steps as integers rather than
#    accumulating floats, includes both endpoints by construction in either
#    direction, and ASSERTS that the last step equals kmax before returning. A
#    range that is not a whole number of steps is refused rather than truncated,
#    because truncation is exactly this bug wearing a different hat.

#   The witness: what proves a step's lever reached the solver

# A witness is a quantity read out of the SOLVED results that is an INPUT ECHO
# of the lever -- PSO reporting back the number it was given. That is the point:
# a response variable moving proves the model did something, but only an input
# echo proves it did what the step asked. The campaign notes' whole finding was
# that a lever can be written, verified, solved and reported while changing
# nothing (SCN_BRN_LMT.ScaleFactor scales Schedule and Sequence, not the limit;
# an unmonitored branch has no flow computed at all), and every one of those
# reads as a clean run.
#
# kind:
#   absolute     -- the results carry the lever's value in the lever's own
#                   units, so the check is observed == what the layer wrote.
#                   The strongest available: it compares the case file against
#                   the result file and needs no reference step.
#   proportional -- the results carry a quantity that scales with the lever, so
#                   the check is observed[i]/observed[0] == value[i]/value[0].

# _check_enforced()  -- W6
#
# W3 asks whether the results echo the value the case asked for. W6 asks the
# question W3 cannot: was that value ever actually in the LP?
#
# For k_line the two are genuinely separable, and the gap is not theoretical.
# PN_Pth.Max is the limit; MinEnforced/MaxEnforced say whether it was enforced.
# This case carries Enforce=0 on all 9,140 branches, so nothing is enforced
# except what CYC_SAI discovery finds -- and the committed reference run, which
# reports all 1,171 monitored paths, is mostly rows of Max=<the file's number>
# with neither side enforced and SolverMw=0. Turn on ReportAllSolvedPaths (the
# documented fix for this study's open reporting-scope question) and every step
# of a k_line sweep would report its derated limit, agree with the layer to the
# digit, and mean nothing. W3 would be green on a sweep with no effect whatever.
#
# WARNING, paid for: read BOTH sides. The first version of this check tested
# MaxEnforced alone, and measured against the reference run that would have
# raised ERROR on the study's flagship corridor -- N210144_N210332_1 is
# enforced on Min in 168 of 168 RT intervals and on Max in none, because the
# flow runs Riesel to Hewitt and binds against the negative limit. A check that
# fails the one sweep already validated by hand is worse than no check.
#
# The rule is per-sweep rather than per-step, deliberately. A corridor that is
# slack at k=1.0 and binds at k=0.8 is a GOOD sweep, and failing its first step
# would punish exactly the experiment worth running. What cannot be tolerated
# is a sweep where the limit was enforced at no step at all: there the lever
# moved a number that never reached the solver.
