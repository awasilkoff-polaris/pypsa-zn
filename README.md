# PyPSA-ZN DevNet --- Datacenter BYOG Grid Modeling

`pypsa-zn` is a research-grade PyPSA workflow for studying datacenter
**Bring-Your-Own-Generation (BYOG)** interaction with the electricity
grid.

The framework uses a deterministic, lightweight six-bus **USA-lite
DevNet** to investigate:

-   Datacenter load growth and load flexibility.
-   Datacenter BYOG participation.
-   Generation availability and derating.
-   Transmission reliability and congestion.
-   System feasibility and generator dispatch.
-   Bus import/export.
-   Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs).
-   System operating cost.

The small network is intentionally designed for interpretability,
controlled experimentation, regression testing, and publication-quality
analysis while remaining structurally compatible with future
larger-network studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generated runtime directories such as `devnet-sld/`, `devnetDC-sld/`,
`pub_figs/`, logs, caches, and temporary outputs may also appear
locally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Source-Controlled Core

The primary source-controlled research stack consists of:

``` text
devnet_menu.py
devnet_cfg.py
devnet_base.py
devnet_sld.py
devnetDC_sld.py
devnet_doe.py
devnet_stress.py

devnet_load_plot.py
devnet_lmp_plot.py
devnet_line_plot.py
devnet_sys_plot.py
devnet_pjm_ne_lmp_plot.py
devnet_pub_figs.py

lib/
devnet_config/
devnet-stress-vectors/
demo/
```

The separation is intentional:

-   Python files implement the modeling and analysis workflow.
-   `devnet_config/` contains user-editable model inputs.
-   `devnet-stress-vectors/` contains research experiment definitions
    and curated analysis inputs.
-   `demo/` provides a presentation-oriented interface to the same
    modeling engine.
-   `lib/` contains shared non-interactive stress and reporting logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Runtime and Generated Directories

The following directories are generated during normal operation and are
not the authoritative source definition of the model:

``` text
devnet-sld/
devnetDC-sld/
pub_figs/
plots/
logs/
demo/demo_out/
lib/__pycache__/
```

### `devnet-sld/` and `devnetDC-sld/`

Generated baseline and datacenter-enabled networks typically contain:

``` text
<selected-devnet>/
├── *.csv
├── plots/
├── logs/
└── stress_out/
```

### `stress_out/`

`devnet_stress.py` writes committed OPF results into the selected DevNet
build:

``` text
stress_out/
├── c1_*.csv
├── c1_*.json
├── c1_dashboard.md
├── c2_*.csv
├── c2_*.json
├── c2_dashboard.md
├── commit_counter.txt
├── index.html
└── _preview/
```

Committed results may include objective, total system load, generator
dispatch, bus net import/export, nodal LMP, and transmission line
loading.

### `pub_figs/`

`devnet_pub_figs.py` generates publication artifacts into:

``` text
./pub_figs/
```

The directory is created only after user confirmation.

Publication Figures and Tables are driven by:

``` text
./devnet-stress-vectors/devnetDC_sysdsg.xlsx
```

The workbook defines active/inactive Scenarios, Events, Commit IDs,
Event timing, Scenario-specific `index.html` sources, Figure/Table
artifacts, artifact numbers, Event grouping, and output filename
suffixes.

`devnet_pub_figs.py` acts as a generic parser and renderer rather than
hard-coding publication Figure numbers or Scenario identities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Configuration

Run:

``` bash
python devnet_cfg.py
```

to create or update:

``` text
devnet_config/
├── devnet_buses.csv
├── devnet_lines.csv
├── devnet_assets.csv
├── devnet_dc.csv
└── devnet_carriers.csv
```

These files define the six-bus topology, line capacities, generation
capacity, regional load, generator marginal cost, datacenter
association, datacenter load, BYOG capacity, BYOG marginal cost, and
PyPSA carriers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Building DevNet

### Baseline DevNet

``` bash
python devnet_sld.py
```

Output: `./devnet-sld/`

### Datacenter BYOG DevNet

``` bash
python devnetDC_sld.py
```

Output: `./devnetDC-sld/`

The datacenter model represents explicit datacenter demand together with
configurable BYOG capacity and marginal cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stress Testing and OPF Results

Run:

``` bash
python devnet_stress.py
```

`devnet_stress.py` is the interactive researcher shell. Shared
non-interactive simulation and reporting logic resides in:

``` text
lib/devnet_stress_lib.py
```

The validated stress workflow supports:

-   Regional load scaling: `k_load`.
-   Transmission capacity reduction: `k_line`.
-   Generation capacity derating/outage: `k_gen`.
-   Generator marginal-cost changes: `mc_bus`.
-   Selectable LMP reporting bus: `lmp_bus`.
-   Datacenter load override: `dc_p_set`.
-   Datacenter BYOG capacity override: `dc_p_nom`.
-   Datacenter BYOG marginal-cost override: `byog_mc`.

Datacenter demand is independently controllable and is not silently
multiplied by regional `k_load` stress.

### Preview and Commit

A researcher can preview an experiment before committing it. Committed
runs receive sequential IDs (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, ...), linking experiment
definitions to solved OPF results.

For detailed execution flow, see `devnet_callstack.md`.

> **Note:** The currently validated research workflow primarily uses the
> `baseline` and `single` stress scenarios. The `sweep_line` workflow is
> retained for future review and is not part of the current validated
> experiment set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Diagnostic Plots

The basic plotting scripts provide diagnostic and exploratory
visualization:

``` text
devnet_load_plot.py
devnet_lmp_plot.py
devnet_line_plot.py
devnet_sys_plot.py
devnet_pjm_ne_lmp_plot.py
```

Some legacy/reference plotting workflows consume curated workbooks under
`devnet-stress-vectors/`, including `devnet_plots.xlsx`,
`devnet_load_tc.xlsx`, `devnet_lmp_tc.xlsx`, and `devnet_line_tc.xlsx`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Publication Figure Workflow

Run:

``` bash
python devnet_pub_figs.py
```

or select the publication-figure option from `devnet_menu.py`.

The workflow is driven by `devnet-stress-vectors/devnetDC_sysdsg.xlsx`:

``` text
Scenario
   ↓
Event definitions
   ↓
Commit IDs
   ↓
OPF results in index.html
   ↓
Artifact definitions
   ↓
Publication Figure / Table
```

Publication chronology Figures can show:

-   Objective / system feasibility.
-   Total system load.
-   Datacenter `p_set`.
-   Datacenter BYOG `p_nom`.
-   Experiment Event Drivers.

Infeasible operating intervals are explicitly identified in the
Objective panel.

Event Driver convention:

-   Grid/system failure, outage, constraint, deration, or congestion →
    **dark red**.
-   Datacenter mitigation/support actions → **blue**.

Generated publication artifacts are written to `./pub_figs/`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reference Snapshots for Developers

Validated historical builds are retained under:

``` text
devnet-reference-runs/
```

Examples include:

``` text
devnet-sld-20Mar2026/
devnetDC-sld-15Apr2026/
devnetDC-sld-04Aug2026/
devnet_config-04Aug2026/
```

These are frozen reference snapshots rather than active runtime builds.
They support regression comparison, historical traceability, research
replication, developer sanity checks, and review of generated PyPSA
network structure.

New working networks should be generated through the current source
workflow rather than by modifying these snapshots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Demonstration Framework

A presentation-oriented demonstration subsystem is provided under
`./demo/`:

``` text
demo/
├── README.md
├── pypsa_zn_demo.py
├── demo_presets.json
├── pypsa-zn-dep.lst
├── pypsa_zn_demo.html
├── pypsa_zn_demo_land.html
├── assets/
└── plots/
```

The demo uses the same DevNet modeling engine as the research workflow.
It is not a separate power-system model.

Both the research shell and demonstration framework reuse:

``` text
lib/devnet_stress_lib.py
```

### Building a Custom Presentation Wrapper

Researchers can use `demo/` as the computational backend for their own
conference, classroom, laboratory, or stakeholder presentation.

A custom presentation wrapper can:

-   Present its own landing page.
-   Define its own narrative/storyboard.
-   Select predefined DevNet experiments.
-   Invoke `pypsa_zn_demo.py`.
-   Display generated scenario results.
-   Reuse or replace the supplied HTML presentation pages.
-   Add organization-specific branding outside the modeling engine.

Recommended separation:

``` text
Presentation / kiosk wrapper
          ↓
demo/pypsa_zn_demo.py
          ↓
demo_presets.json
          ↓
lib/devnet_stress_lib.py
          ↓
PyPSA DevNet
```

This allows researchers to build a custom presentation experience
without forking or rewriting the underlying DevNet OPF implementation.

See `demo/README.md` for demonstration-specific operation and
configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reference Research Artifacts

`devnet-stress-vectors/` contains selected research inputs and
historical artifacts used to reproduce or document earlier DevNet
experiments. These may include stress-case definitions, curated plotting
workbooks, reference stress reports, network images, and
experiment-design workbooks.

The current publication workflow uses `devnetDC_sysdsg.xlsx` as the
experiment/publication definition, while associated solved results are
obtained from the Scenario-specific committed `stress_out/index.html`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design Principles

-   **Determinism** --- explicit configuration and reproducible
    experiments.
-   **Interpretability** --- small network with transparent physical
    behavior.
-   **Causal traceability** --- perturbation → dispatch → constraint →
    system response.
-   **Shared modeling logic** --- research and demo workflows use the
    same stress engine.
-   **Separation of source and generated artifacts**.
-   **Publication reproducibility** --- Figures trace back to explicit
    Events and Commit IDs.
-   **Scalability** --- experimental methods can be transferred to
    larger PyPSA networks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Environment and Dependencies

The workflow has been primarily developed and tested on:

* Windows 11 Pro x64.
* Python 3.13.
* HiGHS through the PyPSA optimization interface.

Preliminary Linux validation has also been performed on:

* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86_64).

  * Preliminary validation only.
  * Full replication runs pending.

Primary Python dependencies include PyPSA, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, openpyxl, scipy, networkx, and HiGHS / `highspy`.

Use the same Python environment for the complete workflow. `devnet_menu.py` launches child scripts using the active Python interpreter.

### Tested Python Environment

The current DevNet workflow has been validated using the installed Microsoft Store Python 3.13 environment:

```text
Python 3.13

C:\Users\ashok\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\
PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe
```

A project-local Python virtual environment is **not required** to run the currently validated DevNet workflow.

### Optional Clean-Slate Virtual Environment

Researchers who prefer an isolated Python environment can create one from the `pypsa-zn` repository directory:

```powershell
python -m venv pypsa-zn-env
```

This creates:

```text
pypsa-zn/
└── pypsa-zn-env/
    ├── Scripts/
    ├── Lib/
    └── pyvenv.cfg
```

Activate it in Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\pypsa-zn-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
pypsa-zn-env\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
source pypsa-zn-env/bin/activate
```

Install the primary dependencies into the activated environment:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pypsa numpy pandas matplotlib scipy networkx openpyxl
```

The virtual environment directory should remain a **local runtime environment** and should not be committed to the repository.

### Capture the Tested Environment Dependency List

The demo workflow includes a dependency snapshot:

``` text
demo/pypsa-zn-dep.lst
```

The supplied dependency list uses the human-readable `Package / Version`
format produced by `pip list`. From the active environment, generate or
refresh it in PowerShell with:

``` powershell
python -m pip list | Out-File -Encoding utf8 .\demo\pypsa-zn-dep.lst
```

For a standard requirements-style package snapshot instead:

``` powershell
python -m pip freeze | Out-File -Encoding utf8 .\demo\requirements-freeze.txt
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Release Diligence

Before publishing or pushing a release:

-   Confirm SPDX/license headers.
-   Confirm `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and third-party notices.
-   Confirm no credentials, private data, or machine-specific paths are
    committed.
-   Confirm generated runtime/cache directories are excluded through
    `.gitignore`.
-   Confirm intentional reference snapshots are clearly identified.
-   Confirm README workflow matches `devnet_menu.py`.
-   Run the complete validated workflow:

``` text
devnet_cfg.py
      ↓
devnet_sld.py
      ↓
devnetDC_sld.py
      ↓
devnet_stress.py
      ↓
diagnostic / publication plots
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Use

The platform supports controlled investigation of how datacenter demand,
load flexibility, and BYOG interact with grid feasibility, generation
adequacy, transmission reliability, transmission congestion, dispatch,
system operating cost, and nodal LMP formation.

The intent is not to reproduce a specific ISO/RTO network. DevNet
provides a controlled experimental environment in which causal
mechanisms can be isolated before applying the methodology to larger and
more complex networks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status

-   Stable validated `baseline` / `single` research workflow.
-   Reproducible DevNet and DevNetDC builds.
-   Shared research/demo stress engine.
-   XLSX-driven publication Figure/Table workflow.
-   Actively used for datacenter BYOG grid research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps

-   Repository release tagging and continued cleanup.
-   Automated regression test harness.
-   Post-processing and hypothesis-test modules.
-   Scaling bridge to larger PyPSA network models.
-   Continued development of research and presentation workflows.
